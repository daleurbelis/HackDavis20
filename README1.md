Hack Davis 
2020


*Executive Summary*
Develop a predictive model that uses historical & current conditions and population trends to forecast the number of residential spaces needed by a future data. 

*Proposal*
Our classification system will recommend areas of development that will see substantial increases in demand for housing. By classifying different cities, neighborhoods, etc HUD agencies, construction companies, private investors, and potential home buyers will be given more information to focus improve housing readiness.  

*Outcome*
This system will help prevent future housing shortages as demand increases. Knowing where housing needs will be in the next decade for example will decrease homelessness, lower purchase/rent costs, and account for growing populations and migration trends.
