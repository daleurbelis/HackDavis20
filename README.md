Executive Statement

-We will create a predictive model able to forecast energy needs for each building on UCD campus.

# Outcome

-The forecasting tool will help in future planning of energy needs and consumption. We belive this will help optomize budget allocation and reduce waste.

 # Features:

1. Forecasting - use ML methods to predict future energy costs and usage  

2. Weather normalization (optomizing energy use using weather as a factor #not climate)

3. Further investigate relationships between building features and energy usage. Does an unknown feature (ie number of floors, building       age)

4. Test for independence between features and costs



# Logistics(tenative, if you want to do something else just roger up): 

-Chris/Kevin will focus primarily on visualization and python. 

-Grant & Jesus will focus on forecasting and deeper relationships between building features

-Dale will focus on alternative energy costs

-John & Alvin will focus on Weather
